# PayrollSolution

This repository hosts a starter payroll platform that includes:

- **Backend** – ASP.NET Core Web API split into Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers under `backend/`.
- **Frontend** – A Vite + React TypeScript client scaffolded under `frontend/payroll-web/` with routing, layout shell, and placeholder pages.

Use the solution file `PayrollSolution.sln` to load all backend and frontend projects into a single workspace.
